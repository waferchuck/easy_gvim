use gvim.exe to get started.

The plugins are
1. A useful welcome screen showing you recent files
2. Tagbar auto list func/var/defines in the current file
3. auto-pairs () {} []
4. put __ under the cursor word.
5. rainbow make nested () with different color
6. Auto popout the omni-complete menu (tab to confirm, Enter to select next)

Some keys are remapped in _vimrc and _gvimrc based on my personal preferences,  feel free to edit in _gvimrc
1. Shift+h/l to move cursor to the front/end of the line, instead of using $ and ^
2. :Grep keyword command will search the keyword in this current folder and display automatically
3. Shift+k to jump to function header
4. Shift+o to jump back
5. \l to search and list the current keyword(where the cursor is) in this document
6. \G to search and list the current keyword(Where the cursor is) in the current folder
7. F10 to toggle the Tagbar
8. F2 to relace ctrl+w to switch window ( i just personally dont like ctrl)
